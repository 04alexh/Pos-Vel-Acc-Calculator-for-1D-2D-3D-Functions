# Pos-Vel-Acc-Calculator-for-1D-2D-3D-Functions
Creates commands that calculate various derivatives and antiderivatives of multiple dimension functions and give points of extrema by inputting x,y,z components.


This program was made in TI-Basic on the TI-Nspire CX CAS II. It should work with a TI-NSPIRE CX CAS, but will not work with TI-NSPIRE CX or CX II.
The computer algebra system is required.

The program has three basic commands, posvec(), velvec(), and accvec(). All three take in inputs for the X, Y, and Z components of some position/velocity/acceleration
function, as well as any intial conditions that may be required. Using these data, the calculator computes the other two functions and gives times for extrema as well.
Additionally, the three derivatives of the X,Y, and Z components are graphed on additional pages.
